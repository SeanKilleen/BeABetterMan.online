The goal of this web site is to move beyond shaming to education, without placing the burden of that education on people who have been on the receiving end of less than stellar behavior on the web. We want to help people realize harmful behaviors in a non-judgmental setting, providing links and material in the hopes that someone might put these words to use and improve their behavior.

[Here's some of the behavior we're trying to change.](/behaviors/)
