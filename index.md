# Don't be that guy!

This is a site written by men, for men, offering perspectives on how to be a better man on-line.

Our goal is to move beyond shaming to education, without placing the burden on that education of people who have been on the receiving end of less than stellar behavior on the web.

Have you been forwarded to this site by someone you've communicated with? We hope you'll take a breath and check out some information here briefly before moving on.

Let's all get better, together.
