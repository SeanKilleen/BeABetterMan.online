BeABetterMan.online is a web site created by a guy on the internet who was tired of seeing guys be jerks to women and LGTBTQ folks on the internet.

The goal of this web site is to help people realize harmful behaviors in a non-judgmental setting, providing links and material in the hopes that someone might put these words to use and improve their behavior. It was inspired by a quote seen in passing:

> "I can't advocate if I refuse to help educate."

This site is under construction, but check back frequently for updates.
