## Okay, so you've been called out.

Before you get angry or defensive back at the person who sent you here: **This is an opportunity.**

## We've done a lot of this stuff before.

The authors of this site aren't somehow immune to bad behavior and lecturing you from a place of superiority. We learned a lot of lessons along the way -- many times by being called out in ways small and large -- and grew as a result. Having come out on the other side of it, we like ourselves bettr and so we're hoping to help you get through the same thing.

## This doesn't make you a bad person...

Everyone starts from a different place in life. The summary of your lived experiences, your advantages and disadvantages, are what got you here. You're not a bad person because you got called out on one topic, and it doesn't mean that somehow everything about you is a toxic stereotype.

## ...as long as you learn from it.

But getting referred to one of these pages by someone probably means that there's room for improvement. And what's wrong with improving ourselves? Nothing, that's what. So this site aims to offer you resources around what your perceived misbehavior may have been, so that you can better understand the perspective of someone who has been on the other end of it, and get some resources for how you might be able to think about in the future.

## Ensure Your Response is Measured.

Did the person who sent you this link send it along with harsh words, or a block? Now is probably not the time to attempt to make your case.

What we recommend:

* **Take a minute**. It doesn't need to get handled immediately. If you want to respond, taking some time to get distance, perspective, and a couple of deep breaths is a good idea before you attempt to engage again. And indeed, the best way forward may be to not engage with this person at all. You need to take some time for reflection, but the actions that someone is calling you out on may have permanently damaged the relationship. Regardless, you know what won't salvage things? A hasty and aggressive response. Take a beat.
* **Read the links thoroughly**. If someone sent you here, it's likely because they believed you'd find information. We try to keep the topics short & informative, and are open to feedback if we don't do that. But try to read through a few times and let things sink in.
