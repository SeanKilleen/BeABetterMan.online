Hooboy. Really? If someone didn't ask for this, you almost certainly shouldn't send it.

## Why It's Harmful

* **It sexualizes a non-sexual space.** Folks deserve to be able to operate in a neutral / public space without it being sexualized, because that's not why they're there in the first place.
* **You don't know their other experiences.** 1 in 4 women experience sexual assault in their lifetimes, and the instances of harassment are astrononmically higher. (TODO: Cite the 1 in 4 statistic). The least you can do is not send unsolicited sexual imagery that wasn't asked for, because you have no idea what it will trigger.
* **It says, "you don't belong here."** Except others besides men *do* belong here. It's a way to attempt to chase someone out of a public space.
