title: \"Women aren't prevented from working in tech.\"
---

Oftentimes white, cisgender[^1] men respond to concerns around systematic disenfranchisement with variations on:

* "Women aren't prevented from working in tech."
* "If you can't keep up, you don't need to work in this industry."
* "Women just aren't cut out to be engineers."

The point seems to be that the industry itself is a "meritocracy" (ðŸ¤®) and that somehow women just can't keep up.

But consider:

* Programming and technology work was originally considered "women's work", which men would avoid.
* Programming and technology work then began to drive more of the world and economy.
* Suddenly, the rate of women in the industry began to go down as men entered the industry once more.
