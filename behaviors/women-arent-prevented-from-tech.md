title: \"Women aren't prevented from working in tech.\"
---

Oftentimes white, cisgender[^1] men respond to concerns around systematic disenfranchisement with variations on:

* "Women aren't prevented from working in tech."
* "If you can't keep up, you don't need to work in this industry."
* "Women just aren't cut out to be engineers."

The point seems to be that the industry itself is a "meritocracy" (ðŸ¤®) and that somehow women just can't keep up.

But consider:

* Programming and technology work was originally considered "women's work", which men would avoid.
* Programming and technology work then began to drive more of the world and economy.
* Suddenly, the rate of women in the industry began to go down as men entered the industry once more.
* There is still a pay gap of ~29% for women in the U.S. tech industry.
* The industry as a whole is not known for having policies that allow women to stay in the workforce, such as competitive child care or maternity leave policies.

## It's not just the system. It's also about personal experience.

But beyond these systemic concerns -- which are real -- if you follow any of the many well-known, trusted women in tech[^2], you will eventually hear a story (or many) about:

* sexual harassment in a professional setting
* overt sexism
* being drowned out or ignored in meetings
* having credit stolen for ideas
* being passed over for promotions
* having expertise continually devalued

If that happened to many people, they'd leave. So it's no surprise that women often look for careers elsehwere.
