title: "Using a sock puppet account to get around a block"
---

If you've been blocked on a social media channel, don't create an additional account (often called a "sock puppet") in the effort to reconnect with somebody, continue an argument, re-state your case, demand an explanation, etc.

The internet is a place where folks are allowed to curate their followers. You don't have to agree with it, but every major social media property allows for the blocking of users for a reason.

You may find that you are extremely offended, angry, or upset that someone has chosen to disengage with you. That's a natural human reaction.

However, it is your choice how to handle and respond to this. For example, you could choose to be introspective and have a personal post-mortem on exactly what happened in that situation.

Attempting to violate a person's clear preference in order to continue to engage with them against their will sends a clear vibe about you -- one of harassment, stalking, and instability. It shows an entitled approach where you believe your preference is more important than someone else's right to curate their online presence and feel safe.

Don't be surprised if the response to this behavior is not only an additional block, but the notification of local authorities or others in the community. At a minimum it will not help your cause, but at that point, it also could be considered a potential safety issue.

If you feel unable to dis-engage and feel the need to escalate the situation, we ask you to consider some other options:

* Take a breath. Step away. The online world is not the real world. There are other people and communities to disengage with.
* Try meditation. This might sound dumb or flippant, but we mean it. Meditation can help center the mind and allow you to let negative feelings pass through you. It can provide an additional way to process these feelings and to separate them from your being. It can channel the desire to fixate on something into a healthier space.
* If you feel the need to be heard, use your own outlets. If you have a social media account, you can choose to use it as you see fit. If you need to vent, vent. Some may find it easier to get things out in a long-form forum such as a blog, or in a more private space, such as a journal.
* Seek counseling. If all of these don't work, it may be helpful to seek out a professional who has experience helping people work through these sorts of feelings. There's no shame in it, and if it's an option for you, it may prove to be valuable even beyond the present situation.
