# Professional Social Media Isn't a Dating Site

If someone's social media account is primarily professional / technical, chances are they are establishing or growing their public persona -- not looking for a list of dating applications.

## FAQs

### But their profile seems fun and a little flirty! Maybe they'd be up for it?

People often read flirtiness into any situation where women aren't completing emotionless. Check your instincts; they're probably wrong.

### I have a crush on someone who is a professional on Twitter. How should I act?

* Know that you are wading into not great territory and that the person you're seeking to know better may be put off by your advances.
* If you rarely interact with this person, know that building a rapport on-line is likely an important first step. Don't *start* in the DMs; *slide into* the DMs, after you've built up rapport and trust and transparency.

With that said, here's a quick summary written by someone who was attracted to someone who had a professional Twitter presence and was able to not only connect to that person, but marry them!
