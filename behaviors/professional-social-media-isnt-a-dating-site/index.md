# Professional Social Media Isn't a Dating Site

If someone's social media account is primarily professional / technical, chances are they are establishing or growing their public persona -- not looking for a list of dating applications.

## FAQs

### Q: But their profile seems fun and a little flirty! Maybe they'd be up for it?

People often read flirtiness into any situation where women aren't completing emotionless. Check your instincts; they're probably wrong.
