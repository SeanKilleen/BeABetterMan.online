title: \"You're too pretty to be a Developer!\"

Hoo-boy. Let's unpack this backwards compliment a bit.

* It assumes that people who are developers can't be attractive, which stereotypes an entire industry.
* It suggests that someone who is attractive could not also be talented, which is far from true.
* It often implies that women cannot be developers, and the shock someone experiences at that realization.
* It states that you know someone is a developer, but that you still find more value in their physical attributes than their skillset or talents.
* You've reduced them to a one-dimensional piece of visual entertainment.

Not cool. Knock it off. It's not received well.
