title: About this Site
---

This is a web site created by a guy on the internet who was tired of seeing guys behave badly toward women and LGBTQ folks online.

It was inspired by a quote seen in passing:

> "I can't advocate if I refuse to help educate."

## Someone blocked me and sent me to this site. Why?!

This site was created to help inform, but also to provide a tool for people who are often on the receiving end of problematic behavior. Experiencing this behavior can be draining, and in an online world, sometimes people find themselves continually explaining or attempting to educate. We'd like to save them that hassle, at least.

## Someone is seeking to limit my right to free speech!

I think [Randall Munroe at xkcd says it best](https://xkcd.com/1357/):

## Who Built this site?

This site is built & authored primarily by Sean Killeen ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjkilleen), [Site](https://SeanKilleen.com)).

Originally, while we didn't go to any great lengths to hide the authorship of the site, we also didn't publish information about the creators here. Why? Because it doesn't matter. The point is that these ideas are important, and marginalized folks have put in far too much labor for far too long attempting to help men not contribute to a cesspool of bad behavior online. We're not seeking credit; we're seeking change.

However, after getting some feedback from those this site aims to help, we felt it was important to stand by the work, so that people see that a white, cis, hetero man believes these issues are worth tackling and working through and wants to put in the effort to do so.
