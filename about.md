title: About this Site
---

This is a web site created by a guy on the internet who was tired of seeing guys behave badly toward women and LGBTQ folks online.

It was inspired by a quote seen in passing:

> "I can't advocate if I refuse to help educate."

## Who Built this site?

While we haven't gone to any great lengths to hide the authorship of the site, we also don't publish information about the creators here.

Why? Because it doesn't matter. The point is that these ideas are important, and marginalized folks have put in far too much labor for far too long attempting to help men not contribute to a cesspool of bad behavior online.

We're not seeking credit; we're seeking change.
